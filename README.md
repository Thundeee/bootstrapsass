# Note Social

Social network for all sticky note enthusiasts! Site is designed for posts to have a limit on characters, a rating system of posts, featured posts and anonymity on who posted which post except if you go on their profile. You will get all posts from your contacts on your feed but you dont know who posted which one. All featured posts are also anonymous and picked by rating over the last few days. Home page is meant to be a little "chaotic" since the theme of the website is sticky notes.

## Design file
The design changed from the wireframe to the final product. I chose to add a hamburger meny for desktop and mobile instead of only mobile since the header got cluttered.
